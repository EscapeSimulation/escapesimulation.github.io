It's always fun starting a new identity online to start creating and publishing content.

First you have to think of a name, I normally start by going to [NameCheckr.com](https://www.namecheckr.com/){:target="_blank"}. NameCheckr allows you to type in a username and will tell you on which social media platforms that username is available.

Normally I think of a name I really want only to type in into NameCheckr to find that it's taken on some of the social media platforms, or worse only taken on one of them meaning you'll be able to register the username on all of the social media platforms bar one, for some reason to me that is more frustrating.

I originally wanted to register BeyondTheSimulation but could see in NameCheckr that it was already taken on  [Reddit.com/u/beyondthesimulation](https://www.reddit.com/u/beyondthesimulation){:target="_blank"}.

From his reddit history I can see he also has a podcast of the same name :
[https://anchor.fm/beyondthesimulation](https://anchor.fm/beyondthesimulation){:target="_blank"}

Isn't stalking people fun, seems he has not posted anything in the last couple months and seems to have given up.

For that reason I abandoned the idea of that username and instead went to thesaurus.com to find another viable verb and settled on Escape Simulation.

Fortunately NameCheckr said this was available everywhere which I was surprised with so I quickly registered a github account and email adress, disqus etc. I'm not going to buy a .com domain just yet as I normally get all excited create these accounts and then abandon them when I get over the initial rush.

You can find EscapeSimulation at the following locations :

* [https://github.com/escapesimulation](https://github.com/escapesimulation){:target="_blank"}
* [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWNtbyO_XiM7PdVpP8_dcxA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWNtbyO_XiM7PdVpP8_dcxA){:target="_blank"}
* [https://www.bitchute.com/channel/ytECUUkLWpnE/](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/ytECUUkLWpnE/){:target="_blank"}
* [https://www.minds.com/escapesimulation/](https://www.minds.com/escapesimulation/){:target="_blank"}

Hopefully I can figure out how to automate the syndication of the content so it can be published on various platforms at once and avoid to much manual work.

I want to focus on the cryptocurrency based platforms and avoid Youtube, Twitter, Facebook as much as possible as they are to prone to censorship, demonitisation and banning.

I'm also trying to avoid any platforms that require mobile number verification, I want to remain anonymous so I'm free to post as I wish.

The username EscapeSimulation is obviously a play on [the simulation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis){:target="_blank"} which proposes that all of reality, including the Earth and the universe, is in fact an artificial simulation, most likely a computer simulation.

EscapeSimulation to me means opening your mind to new ideas, trying to figure out how to escape the rat race. Trying to find ways of living more efficiently, frugally, more intelligently.

I want to produce content that I enjoy and explore a broad range of topics covering anything that I come across.

I hope to do youtube videos with accompanying articles on this site with links to references etc.

The website is hosted on Github Pages which has the benefits of using source control, is free and very fast as it's static content.

I'm going to try and keep the website simple and try focus on the content instead.
