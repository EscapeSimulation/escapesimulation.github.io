## Escape Simulation episode 001!

The first post/episode of <b>Escape Simulation</b> I think instead of trying to
do one post at a time on a single topic I'm just going to cover multiple topics
in one post, I probably won't have to much to go over for each topic,
just want to cover what I've come across during the week.

A bit of a weekly round up of my life and current events. I normally get into
reading about whatever is going on in the world, sometimes a little obsessively.

I also love to delve into conspiracy theories that people come up with, so I'll
probably cover some conspiracies, don't take them too seriously : )

So where to start, what have I been up to this week?

So far I've created this new website. I've created a github pages website, a reddit account.
You can't create a subreddit until I think you have at least 1000 karma or something like that.
I've found for me the easiest way to get reddit karma is to go to the
[AskReddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/){:target="_blank"}
sort by new and then just start answering all the AskReddit posts that come up.
If you get in quick enough and leave a witty remark, if that post blows up on
reddit you're likely to get 1000 karma pretty quickly, from there you can create a new subreddit for yourself.

I created an account on [Minds.com](https://www.minds.com/escapesimulation/){:target="_blank"} and Steemit.com looks like 3 dudes at Steemit just quit, not sure what that's about :

Minds and Steemit are alternative social media platforms based on cryptocurrency. So If you post content that people like they'll reward you with cryptocurrency that you can sell or send to someone else.

It's a good concept hopefully it continues to grow.

I've also created an account on [BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/ytECUUkLWpnE/){:target="_blank"} which is an alternative to Youtube, if people like you're content on BitChute you'll be rewarded in crypto, PewDiePie said he was switching over to BitChute at some point, I'm not sure if he ended up following through with it.

I've going to have to figure out my content creation workflow, I've always struggled with how to create content.
Do you write the script first, do you do the video first and then narrate the content. Do you just wing it and have to tabs open and hope that the magic flows when you press record. How do you easily upload the content to your accounts. Should you just focus on one platform or should you hedge your bets and upload to multiple accounts.

I've been reading a lot of posts on [https://reddit.com/r/ausfinance](https://reddit.com/r/ausfinance){:target="_blank"} lately
and have been learning about the concepts of <b>Financial Independence Retire Early (FIRE)</b>.

Basically the concept is if you think about how much money you require each year to cover your expenses, lets say $40,000
you take that number and multiply it by 30 years which I guess is the number of years you'll live after retirement, which comes to $1,200,000 that is the amount you need to save to FIRE.

To achieve that amount you should aim to be saving 50-70% of your income.

The money you save should be invested in someway not just saved as cash in a bank account. The common way is to invest in Exchange Traded Funds (ETF's) or Real Estate.

The most popular ETF's spoken about are [Vanguard ETF's](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/productType=etf){:target="_blank"}, they seem to be the popular choice as they have low management fees and provide good diversified investment options.

The popular Vanguard ETF's to invest in are :

* [VDHG - Vanguard Diversified High Growth](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8221/assetCode=balanced/?overview){:target="_blank"}
* [VAS - Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8205/?overview){:target="_blank"}
* [VGS - Vanguard MSCI Index International Shares ETF](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=8212/assetCode=equity/?overview){:target="_blank"}
* [VTS - Vanguard U.S. Total Market Shares Index](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=0970/?overview){:target="_blank"}
* [VEU - Vanguard All-World ex-U.S. Shares Index ETF](https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/etf/portId=0991/assetCode=equity/?overview){:target="_blank"}

You can buy them in various ways either directly from the company, as shares on the ASX etc I've chosen to purchase them on the ASX as when you purchase in blocks of $4000 to $5000 it's a cost effective way of purchasing them.

Once you have your FIRE amount achieved you then withdraw 4% of that money each year to live off and the money should replenish itself because the market should hopefully return an average of 10% each year.

One of the people I've come across through reading is the Aussie Fire Bug blog, he is going with the following ETF allocation :

source - [https://www.aussiefirebug.com/how-to-buy-etfs/](https://www.aussiefirebug.com/how-to-buy-etfs/){:target="_blank"}

He prefers this to VDHG as he has calculated the management fees are lower. Some people are also turned off VDHG because it contains a certain allocation of bonds which they don't consider to be high growth, so instead opt for the above split.

So I decided to purchase VDHG shares a couple of weeks ago and the proceeded to experience one of the largest crashes in history : (

You can't make this up folks...

Then I decided to double down and buy more shares in the dip, the price started to recover but I have a feeling it might be a Dead Cat Bounce, and it might plummit further... we're going to have to wait and see.

This all seems to be due to fears of the Coronavirus.
